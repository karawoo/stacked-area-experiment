            Please look at each of the charts below and determine which segment
            of the chart is smaller at the point where the chart is marked.
            Then, provide a quick visual judgment of what percentage the smaller
            segment is of the larger segment. <b>Only consider the sizes of each
            segment at the point where the chart is marked.</b> You can imagine
            drawing a vertical line through this point and comparing the
            segments to determine which is longer. However, do <em>not</em> try
            to make precise measurements, either mentally or with a physical
            object such as a pencil or your finger. We are interested in how
            well people make these judgments <b>spontaneously and without the
            help of external aids</b>. We will check that your responses are
            reasonable by comparing to other workers' responses for the same
            chart.

                  2. Make a quick visual judgment of what <em>percentage (%) the
                    smaller segment is of the larger segment</em>.
                    Do <em>not</em> try to make precise measurements, either
                    mentally or with a physical object such as a pencil or your
                    finger. Use numeric values only. If you believe they are the
                    same size, write 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fill in the blank: At the point where the chart is marked, the
                  smaller segment is <span style="text-decoration: underline;
                  white-space: pre"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> percent of
                  the larger segment.
                </p>
              </label>
              <input class="form-control" type="number" name="Q5" style="width: 200px;" min = "0" max = "100" step = "0.01" required />
            </div>

            <div class="qfields">
              <label>
                3. How tall is the SMALLER segment at the point where the chart
                is marked? Use the scale of the Y axis in your answer. For
                example, if you think the bottom of the segment is at Y = 2 and
                the top is at Y = 5, you should write 3. Again, do not try to
                make precise measurements.
