              Please look at each of the charts below and determine which segment of
              the chart is smaller at the point where the chart is marked. Then,
              provide a quick visual judgment of what percentage the smaller segment
              is of the larger segment. <b>Only consider the sizes of each segment
                at the point where the chart is marked with the letters A and B.</b>
              You can imagine drawing a vertical line through this point and
              comparing the segments to determine which is longer. However,
              do <em>not</em> try to make precise measurements, either mentally or
              with a physical object such as a pencil or your finger. We are
              interested in how well people make these judgments <b>spontaneously

              This is a training task that will illustrate the types of questions we
              are asking. In the main task, the charts will not be marked with lines
              and question 2 will have a write-in box instead of multiple choice
              answers. If you accept additional HITs in this batch, you will not
              need to repeat the training task.
